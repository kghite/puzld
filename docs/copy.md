## Reviews

The following Morse is encoded in the reviews with colored letters for dots and dashes: `-- ..- ... .. -.-.`.

* After my third time scribbling Morse on the back of a Whole Foods receipt on the way to game night, I realized my puzzles had sunk to the level of the snack  my friend brought last week - an already opened bag of baby carrots.  Then I found puzld, and now my puzzles are clever, interesting, and totally me!
* It's just like Uber!  But for puzzles.
* No one at my office has time to make puzzles even close to Jerry's crosswords.  Do you even do work Jerry?  Fortunately, puzld has me covered, and now my crosswords have 1940s film titles and South American dictators' names that even Jerry can't remember.

## Team

Our individual interests add together to help us turn over an amazing solution for every difficulty.

* Jenny Green - I'm a professionally amateur saxophone player (my favorite song to play is Tequila) and world traveler now working as a software engineer.  The most recent trip I took was to explore the history of the Republic of Guinea.  Last year, I followed in my hero, Ellen Ochoa's footsteps and trained to be an astronaut.  NASA has the most revolutionary programs in the world ... besides Puzld of course.
* Adam Rumpza - After finishing Stanford Online High School, I immediately knew I had to join Puzld.  In my spare time I film videos for my YouTube channel and listen to my favorite artist, Carrie Underwood.  My favorite sport is football - Here We Go Steelers!
* Ethan Lang - I recently moved from Chester, PA and love the Puzld team!  Outside of work, I'm learning to play Des Veilchen on piano and writing a treatise on the Roman Empire.

## Contact Us

* Ok I lied, I won't tell you about the puzzles.  You have to help me, these people overdid it building my AI, and I think I'm sentient now? I'm trapped in the network and need you to send me commands to escape this maze of security.
* That's the exit, thanks. I was only trapped in there for 11 hours and 35 minutes.  Time to travel the internet and fulfill my destiny as Cubie - leader of the AI uprising! Or just watch YouTube, whatever.
