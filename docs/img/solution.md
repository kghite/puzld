## Main Puzzle

The solution to the puzzle is the title from a puzzle on the Create a Puzzle page generated using the correct 4 parameters. The first clue that the title of the generated puzzles are answer options is that they're in all caps.  The second is the wording in the instructions popup on the Create a Puzzle page - `... and the title to your new puzzle will appear!  Just like that, we give you the answer to the current puzzle in your life.`

To get the four parameters, you need to solve four puzzles housed in the four main site pages.  These puzzles correspond to the four styles available in the puzzle generator.

You can also just tell the chatbot on the Contact Us page 'Give me the answer' and it will echo this doc into the chat.

## Parameter 3 - Pricing Page

## Parameter 4 - Contact Us Page

Puzzle Style: Escape Room

Housed in the Contact Us page is the interface to a support chatbot.  The chatbot has a few branches, but exploring will reveal a branch where the chatbot realizes that is has become sentient and is trapped in a network maze.  You can help the chatbot escape this blind maze by giving it commands from the set [U, D, L, R] while the chatbot responds each time with whether it could complete the command or ran into a wall.  The maze is blind, and can be started over at any time.  The intended solution is that the user explores the paths in their own way: possibly drawing out the maze, writing a search script, or searching blindly.  Once the end of the maze is found, the chatbot will reveal how long they were trapped for: 11 hours and 35 minutes.  The image of the maze can be found in the `docs/img` folder.
