# puzld Solution

If you don't want the answers spoiled turn back now.  Solution at the bottom.

## Main Puzzle

The solution to the puzzle is the title from a puzzle on the Create a Puzzle page generated using the correct 4 parameters. The first clue that the title of the generated puzzles are answer options is that they're in all caps.  The second is the wording in the instructions popup on the Create a Puzzle page - `... and the title to your new puzzle will appear!  Just like that, we give you the answer to the current puzzle in your life.`

To get the four parameters, you need to solve four puzzles housed in the four main site pages.  These puzzles correspond to the four styles available in the puzzle generator.

You can also just tell the chatbot on the Contact Us page 'Give me the answer' and it will echo this doc into the chat.

## Parameter 1 - Reviews Page

Puzzle Style: Ciphers

The reviews are encoded left to right with a series of morse letters with the dots and dashes represented by blue and green letters.  These letters spell out the solution to the style parameter.

## Parameter 2 - Team Page

Puzzle Style: Trivia

The team page contains three bios, introduced by the phrase 'Our individual interests add together to help us turn over an amazing solution for every difficulty.'  The key to this puzzle is to research every team member's interests to realize that they each seem to be obsessed with a specific year that will crop up in every hobby or life event they mention.  Adding these years together gives 2006 + 1958 + 476 = 4440, which can be turned over to get the difficulty parameter solution.

## Parameter 3 - Pricing Page

Puzzle Style: Math Games

The pricing page is headed with the error message `Error 57: Number translation module import failed.  Defaulting numerals 1-9 to Xajani.` Some numbers on the page do not appear in English, but can be translated using the relations stated in the pricing explainations.  The digits 1, 2, 5, and 10 are base words that can be added in decreasing value using 'g' to create compound words for larger digits.  For example 'apone' means 1, miku means 2, and mikugapone means 3.  The digits and their compounding ability can be used to solve the puzzle given at the end of the page to find the devs favorite theme, the solution to the theme parameter.

## Parameter 4 - Contact Us Page

Puzzle Style: Escape Room

Housed in the Contact Us page is the interface to a support chatbot.  The chatbot has a few branches, but exploring will reveal a branch where the chatbot realizes that is has become sentient and is trapped in a network maze.  You can help the chatbot escape this blind maze by giving it commands from the set [U, D, L, R] while the chatbot responds each time with whether it could complete the command or ran into a wall.  The maze is blind, and can be started over at any time.  The intended solution is that the user explores the paths in their own way: possibly drawing out the maze, writing a search script, or searching blindly.  Once the end of the maze is found, the chatbot will reveal how long they were trapped for: 11 hours and 35 minutes.  The image of the maze can be found in the `docs/img` folder.

## Provided Hints

1) Solve each Style to the info you need to win the title. (The remaining four hints match the following order: Reviews, Team, Pricing, Contact Us.)
2) Reviews - Match the colored letters to dots and dashes to solve the style.
3) Team - Find three years to add together.  Then turn the solution over to solve the difficulty.
4) Pricing - Decode the numbers in the developer's puzzle to solve the theme.  The simple words for the digits 1, 2, 5, and 10 can be compounded using g to create complex words for other numbers.
5) Contact Us - Make the chatbot realize it's sentient by talking to it and then help it escape the maze to solve the duration.  You can try drawing the maze on paper as you explore it.  It's a 12x12 grid.  Directions remain in the same orientation the whole time.
